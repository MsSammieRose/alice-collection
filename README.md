# Alice Collection - Wonderland Whimsy

A UX project to catalog my collection of Alice in Wonderland books

## Project Goals

1. Learn and use Chakra UI in a React/Typescript Project
2. Do things differently - like importing the fonts from fontsource instead of using Google fonts
3. Create a fully responsive application

## Pre-requisites

1. `nvm use 18` [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors
in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section
about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is
ready to be deployed!
